Macro trends blogger and economist David Woo,  CEO of David Woo Unbound ‪@DavidWooUnbound‬, joins Julia La Roche on episode 228 in a two-part interview.  On Monday, he rejoined to provide analysis on China's DeepSeek AI breakthrough and the massive macro implications. On Friday, he provided a deep dive into Trump's second term strategy and the global chess moves, from US-China negotiations to the crucial role of Mexico in border security. 

In Part 1, Woo discusses how DeepSeek's AI model from China has impacted markets, with the NASDAQ down 3% and Nvidia dropping over 16%. He examines how this development challenges US tech monopolies' dominance and what this means for US economic exceptionalism and tech sector valuations.

In Part 2, Woo analyzes the challenges facing Trump's second term, particularly regarding fiscal policy and the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. He highlights the critical role of the Freedom Caucus, which holds significant power with Republicans' one-seat majority in the House. The discussion covers several key areas:
The potential alliance between the Freedom Caucus and Elon Musk on fiscal policy
Mexico's proactive approach to border security and trade relations
Contrasting positions of Mexico and Canada on trade negotiations
The complexities of the TikTok situation and potential solutions
US-China relations and the possibility of returning to the Phase One trade agreement
Investment opportunities in Chinese equities, the Mexican peso, and 5-year US Treasuries

[00:00] I'm sort of like I have this reputation
[00:01] as being Trump's whisper Trump whisper
[00:04] on Wall Street so like you know I
[00:06] nothing he said really surprised me but
[00:08] one thing he said which I think a lot of
[00:10] people didn't pick up on which is like
[00:12] the most important thing he said in his
[00:14] speech he said he wanted to be remember
[00:16] as a peacemaker do you know who was the
[00:20] last US president who talked about
[00:22] wanting to be a peacemaker in his
[00:25] presidential inauguration speech it was
[00:27] wood Wilson in 19 13 on the eve of World
[00:32] War
[00:33] I David Woo CEO of David Woo Unbound it
[00:36] is great to welcome you back to the show
[00:38] for folks who are watching and listening
[00:40] David joined us on Friday morning for an
[00:42] extended conversation on the macro
[00:44] landscape but I wanted to get him back
[00:46] on just for a brief um episode here just
[00:50] in a nice addition to our conversation
[00:52] because over the weekend you may have
[00:54] noticed that deep seek this R1 model um
[00:58] coming out of this company from China
[01:00] that just really burst onto the scene is
[01:02] making huge waves in Silicon Valley and
[01:05] Wall Street and so I just wanted to
[01:06] bring David back on to get his take uh
[01:09] David what is kind of your big picture
[01:11] thought on this model from China this
[01:14] open- Source model that was made it just
[01:16] a fraction of the cost from the models
[01:18] that we're seeing here in the US out of
[01:19] you know open AI um it seems like this
[01:22] could actually be a bit of a macro story
[01:24] we're seeing you know stocks the big
[01:26] tech stocks selling off Nvidia down over
[01:29] 12% and NASDAQ down I last I checked
[01:31] around 3% what is your take um as to
[01:34] what is happening here I I think I think
[01:37] it's a very good question and I think
[01:39] from that point of view like I think
[01:40] deep seek you know it's not just a
[01:43] company specific Story I mean because
[01:46] there are a lot of equity traders who
[01:48] just look at individual stocks this is
[01:50] one of these stories that has massive
[01:52] Global macro implications so from that
[01:55] point of view I mean I think the
[01:57] significance goes Way Beyond what
[01:59] happening in AI or Nidia or NASDAQ it
[02:03] really has fairly profound I think
[02:06] implication and let me see if I can
[02:07] explain myself what I mean by that I
[02:10] think first of all there's no doubt
[02:12] there's no doubt you know if you think
[02:14] about this you know like you know people
[02:17] have been talking about us economic
[02:19] exceptionalism for the last two years
[02:22] okay and I've been saying this for a
[02:24] while that this economic
[02:27] exceptionalism evidenced by the
[02:29] outperformance of the US economy
[02:30] outperformance of the US Stock Market
[02:32] the fact that US dollar was trading at a
[02:34] 40-year high all reflect two very simple
[02:38] actually the major themes if you like
[02:41] okay one was of course foreign policy
[02:45] under Joe Biden which was literally
[02:48] pushing the world towards the brings of
[02:50] World War II and that obviously you know
[02:54] created a safe haven basically in the US
[02:56] because the US is far from conflict and
[02:59] that's one of the the reasons why the US
[03:00] marketed so well the US dollar did very
[03:02] well largely because whether you are us
[03:05] adversaries or us you know allies alike
[03:09] okay the conflicts we've seen escalating
[03:12] around the world the last three years
[03:14] have hit you pretty hard okay now the
[03:16] other major theme that has propelled
[03:19] this US economic exceptionalism has been
[03:21] of course AI because 90% of AI until now
[03:25] has been you know developed by us
[03:27] companies and adopted by us companies
[03:30] right it's actually very interesting
[03:31] because if you look at if you look at
[03:34] for example the US stock market in terms
[03:36] of his market capitalization as a share
[03:38] of the world stock market capitalization
[03:41] okay two years ago was roughly around
[03:46] 53% okay today is now at
[03:49] 63% I mean literally it increased by 10
[03:53] percentage point in the space of just
[03:55] two years since open AI launch is CH GPT
[03:59] okay okay so from that point of view you
[04:01] know like it's interesting because you
[04:04] know like you could really make the case
[04:07] that um that this is the reason why what
[04:10] we're talking about here why deep sea
[04:12] could be com a major GameChanger not
[04:16] just about AI but about us economic
[04:19] exceptionalism okay now think about it
[04:21] this way
[04:23] right you know what this thing really
[04:26] has to do with is the fact that we all
[04:28] know about the tech Monopoly in the US
[04:30] right there are seven of them right I
[04:32] mean they have massive power just think
[04:34] about this US the US economy is less
[04:37] than 20% of world GDP on a purchasing
[04:40] power parody basis but the US Stock
[04:42] Market is 65% World stock market on top
[04:45] of that 30% of US market is now Tech
[04:50] like with the Magnus 7 counting for 25%
[04:53] so you can see the general story here
[04:55] that the US tech monopolies the
[04:58] Microsoft the Amazon the world have
[05:01] become sort of the goose that LSD golden
[05:03] eggs for the US now but to understand
[05:06] what that really means you really have
[05:08] to look at their profitability because I
[05:09] mean at the end of the day stock price
[05:11] is a is a reflection of the earnings of
[05:15] these companies the reality is if you
[05:17] look at you know these three companies
[05:19] alone Microsoft Amazon and Google's they
[05:23] control about
[05:25] 65% of the cloud business globally 65%
[05:32] of cloud computing basically is
[05:34] dominated by these three guys and this
[05:36] is by far this is one of the most
[05:38] lucrative business in the world like in
[05:40] Tech right and the reason why it's
[05:44] lucrative and you know company you know
[05:47] and that it's a high profit margin
[05:48] business is because guess what because
[05:51] it's a capital intensive business as a
[05:54] result you need to have very very deep
[05:57] pocket to play in the sector this is why
[06:00] you know Google Microsoft and Amazon
[06:03] even Facebook they were throwing money
[06:05] like there's no tomorrow buying the
[06:07] video chips over the last two years as
[06:08] though they were like free because they
[06:11] wanted to basically put themselves so
[06:12] way ahead of everybody else they they'll
[06:15] be able to maintain a monopoly so that
[06:18] they can continue to enjoy incredibly
[06:21] high gross margin right I mean I can
[06:22] tell you like one of my I can tell you a
[06:25] major US Car Credit c credit card
[06:27] company a major one okay I had a chat
[06:30] with their Chief technology officer not
[06:32] so long ago and they were telling me
[06:34] like oh three years ago Microsoft show
[06:36] up at their doorstep and offer to take
[06:38] it off their hands like that is to for
[06:41] micros for basically for this company to
[06:44] Outsource his entire it Department to
[06:47] Microsoft you know basically by signing
[06:49] essentially a cloud Arrangement because
[06:51] that means everything has to go into the
[06:52] cloud okay and this company did exactly
[06:55] that they practically like five 90% of
[06:58] the ID Department and he said to me like
[07:01] you never never believe it David because
[07:03] Microsoft just came along recently you
[07:06] know saying that the contract needs to
[07:07] be renewed three years later and and I
[07:10] said well how much do they want he said
[07:13] you would not believe it they asked for
[07:15] a 300% increase wow and for this company
[07:20] like wow you know now it's even too late
[07:23] for them to rebuild I mean this is a
[07:25] major major Len household name okay
[07:27] we're not even I don't want to basically
[07:28] mention their name because I don't want
[07:30] you know I don't want to get anybody
[07:31] into trouble but what I'm telling you is
[07:33] that these monopolies are now literally
[07:36] fleecing American companies let along
[07:38] basically companies outside the US now
[07:40] and be they they're fleeing them because
[07:42] they can because they own they control
[07:45] 65% of this sector okay which they
[07:48] believe the AI has only okay you know
[07:51] basically um created an even thicker
[07:54] moat you know like you know wor Buffett
[07:56] talks about moat okay essentially white
[07:58] moat they think like AI has like
[08:01] provided this huge Mo around their
[08:04] monopolies and this is why they're able
[08:06] to push up their prices to these like
[08:08] incredible levels now so now let's talk
[08:12] about what deep seek actually does to
[08:14] this right so the idea is that US
[08:18] economic so the the Assumption in the
[08:20] market until now until you know
[08:22] basically Friday is that US economic
[08:25] exceptionalism is not going to be
[08:27] challenged anytime any anytime soon
[08:31] because US tech monopolies have been
[08:33] empowered by AI they're going to come to
[08:36] dominate the whole world and then
[08:38] they're gonna have the backing of the US
[08:39] government now we don't know where Trump
[08:40] stands on this because you know Biden
[08:43] definitely had a very clear you know
[08:45] basically view he and basically Rondo
[08:47] his Commerce Secretary who only two
[08:50] weeks ago you know you know basically
[08:52] introduced this new AI sanction
[08:54] framework you know I I live in Israel
[08:56] even Israel is not in the first tier to
[08:58] the extent that even Israel will no
[09:00] longer under this basically new uh
[09:03] framework purchase AI chips you know
[09:06] according to his desire like the US
[09:08] government was going to decide like how
[09:10] many AI chips you get to buy because
[09:12] like we don't want anybody to have the
[09:14] possibility of challenging the US
[09:16] technological hedgemon anytime soon see
[09:19] the point here is that the market until
[09:21] now has understood that that that you
[09:24] know at a technology level at a
[09:27] basically money level at a political
[09:29] level that the US economic
[09:31] exceptionalism is going to be here to
[09:33] stay for the next thousand years that
[09:34] was what the markets are and de deep
[09:37] SE now let's just think about this for a
[09:40] moment because DC published the reports
[09:43] of their performance results already
[09:46] last Monday a week ago right that was
[09:50] all I mean the whole thing R1 thing that
[09:51] you had mentioned that the fact that
[09:53] they they finished Head to Head
[09:55] head-to-head with open AI that came
[09:58] already a week ago in fact back in
[10:01] December when they you know launched
[10:04] their new another basically AI model it
[10:07] didn't even barely basically even hit
[10:09] the front page news because the
[10:10] mainstream media was not
[10:11] interested the reason why this piece of
[10:14] news that already became publicly
[10:17] available last Monday only hit the
[10:19] market this morning is because the
[10:22] market didn't know if a you know if this
[10:25] company deep SE was making up the
[10:27] numbers nobody really UND understands
[10:29] how the process works well you say okay
[10:31] fine so you've got these third- party
[10:33] Benchmark that you've outperformed open
[10:35] a arm but what does that mean okay so it
[10:38] was not until the CEO of Microsoft in
[10:41] Davos over the weekend said that he was
[10:43] truly impressed he said super impressive
[10:46] he was referring to the uh the results
[10:49] that all of a sudden Marcus said well if
[10:52] Microsoft CEO says so it must be it must
[10:54] be true because honestly let's just
[10:57] think about this for a moment you think
[10:58] for moment let's just say after those
[11:01] results came out you don't think like
[11:04] Chachi open AI Google Gemini didn't all
[11:07] rush to try to you know form an
[11:10] independent assessment of the validity
[11:13] of the test results they came up with of
[11:15] course they did because this stuff is
[11:17] readly a available right I mean you can
[11:20] actually do this so the the Assurance
[11:23] from Microsoft CEOs and others at dobl
[11:27] that this is actually totally culture
[11:29] genuine is what really you know scaring
[11:32] the out of the market yeah well
[11:34] David I appreciate you hopping back on
[11:36] here just to fill us in um and what it
[11:39] says about us exceptionalism going
[11:41] forward and as he point out in our
[11:42] conversation you're bullish on Chinese
[11:44] stocks bearish on the US dollar so thank
[11:47] you again for the update really
[11:48] appreciate you Juliet I just want to say
[11:51] one more thing before we get off because
[11:52] just I want you to incorporate this in
[11:54] this thing right this is the most
[11:55] important thing this is not about
[11:57] whether what deep SE did or is R real
[12:01] Innovation or not this is not the point
[12:03] I mean for all I know they copied it who
[12:06] cares you know the point here is that
[12:08] you can sync hundreds of billion dollars
[12:10] into a technology if it can be copied
[12:13] easily then that Technologies is worth
[12:17] nothing and that is what Wall Street is
[12:20] trying to reprice today which is that as
[12:23] much as hundreds of billion dollars been
[12:25] pointed into American AI if you you if
[12:28] you cannot monetize it then it's worth
[12:31] nothing no matter how great a technology
[12:33] is and that is the problem that
[12:36] basically nevia Microsoft Amazon or
[12:39] asking themselves today David Woo CEO of
[12:43] David Woo Unbound a global forum devoted
[12:46] to the promotion of fact-based debates
[12:49] about markets politics and economics and
[12:51] also the former head of global interest
[12:53] rates foreign exchange Emerging Markets
[12:55] fixed income strategy and economics
[12:57] research at Bank of America and a friend
[12:59] of this show and our most popular guest
[13:02] today it is so great to welcome you back
[13:04] to the show and great to see you as
[13:06] always David we always appreciate having
[13:08] you on the show thank you so much for
[13:10] having me I love the show well that
[13:12] means a lot um and this this audience
[13:14] loves hearing from you and we were just
[13:17] chatting uh before we came online here
[13:19] that the last time you and I had spoken
[13:21] it was right before the election you had
[13:23] actually said that Trump was going to
[13:24] win and win meaningfully you nailed that
[13:26] call again and I know you nailed the
[13:28] call back in 2016 2020 um so you're
[13:32] always nailing those big election calls
[13:34] uh right down to like the nitty-gritty
[13:37] um but now we are into 2025 Trump uh has
[13:40] already been inaugurated uh first week
[13:42] of the administration now and so let's
[13:45] kind of start where we always start
[13:47] because A lot's going to change and will
[13:49] change and has changed that 2025 big
[13:53] picture macro view where are we today
[13:57] what is the Outlook and as you know
[13:58] David you could take all the time you
[14:00] need to set the table sure okay I think
[14:04] you know like you
[14:06] know what I would say is this I mean I
[14:09] mean obviously markets have been on fire
[14:11] ever since the election everybody thinks
[14:14] well it's going to be like a literally
[14:16] uh you know a sort of like um a Walkin
[14:19] the park for Trump 2.0 because the
[14:21] trifecta because all these things right
[14:24] but I actually think that as much as I'm
[14:26] probably the biggest Trump supporter you
[14:28] know and I didn't don't say this lightly
[14:30] like in fact the last four years I think
[14:32] I was like a Persona Ngata on Wall
[14:35] Street because I was seen as the biggest
[14:37] Trump supporter which made me completely
[14:39] Untouchable okay and all of a sudden
[14:42] literally like since the election like
[14:43] my phone has not stopped ring I've been
[14:45] on CNBC every week in the last six weeks
[14:47] believe or not okay so from that point
[14:50] of view like because everybody wants to
[14:52] talk about Trump however okay I'm much
[14:55] more concerned about the challenges that
[14:57] Trump will be facing because I think is
[14:59] going to be anything but a walk in a
[15:01] park and I'm going want to basically put
[15:03] them into perspective for you about what
[15:06] I mean by that because I think this is
[15:07] very very important first of all you
[15:10] know as Scott Besson said you know
[15:12] during his testimony this is his know
[15:15] nomination for the treasury secretary
[15:17] job Scott said it rightly he said that
[15:20] extending the
[15:22] 2020 extending the 2017 tax cuts would
[15:26] be is the biggest single economic issue
[15:30] 2025 right he's referring to the Trump
[15:33] tax cuts that went into effect in 2017
[15:36] which are set to expire at the end of
[15:38] this year right we're talking about the
[15:40] personal income tax piece so if nothing
[15:43] changes if this is not done America
[15:45] going to wake up on January 1st
[15:49] 2026 okay paying higher
[15:52] taxes okay now obviously if if if this
[15:56] is what happens okay you know the US
[15:58] econ is going go in the recession I mean
[16:00] a big time recession 2026 and this is
[16:02] the reason why Scott bessin said that
[16:05] this is the biggest economic issue of
[16:07] the day now so therefore the question
[16:09] you have to ask yourself is like how
[16:10] easy is going to be for Trump to extend
[16:12] his tax cut I would argue this the
[16:16] answer to this question is complex which
[16:17] I want to basically walk you through it
[16:19] because I think it sort of involves a
[16:21] lot of things and I want to basically
[16:23] make sure that I make myself as clear as
[16:24] possible for your viewers yeah go for it
[16:27] now first of all you know
[16:29] the first statement I would make which
[16:31] sounds kind of strange perhaps to some
[16:33] people is that the biggest winner of the
[16:36] 2024 us elections was the freedom caucus
[16:40] now you may not even know who the what
[16:42] is the freedom caucus but the freedom
[16:44] caucus is this group of 31 Republican
[16:48] congressmen and women whom I consider to
[16:51] be the last fiscal Hawks in Washington
[16:54] right I mean these are people who sort
[16:56] of come from you know I don't know
[16:58] Kansas
[16:59] Texas you know you know largely from the
[17:03] south or the
[17:04] Midwest who decided to go to Washington
[17:07] for only one reason which was to stop
[17:10] the debt Clock they see the US federal
[17:14] debt as being evil right the biggest
[17:18] challenge facing the US so they think
[17:20] they have basically decided to go to
[17:22] Washington to basically stop profligacy
[17:25] fiscal profligacy to save America okay
[17:28] now these people the reason why I said
[17:31] that these people were the biggest
[17:33] winner of the 2024 elections is because
[17:37] as much as Trump won the trifecta
[17:39] meaning you know Republicans won the
[17:42] Senate and the house the House Majority
[17:44] that the Republican currently commends
[17:46] is the most narrow majority in 90 years
[17:51] in 90 years not since
[17:53] 1931 okay in fact if you recall the
[17:56] Republicans won a majority of five seats
[17:59] okay in November in the house and then
[18:01] Matt gets resigned because he thought
[18:03] was going to become you know attorney
[18:05] general and then Trump pulled three
[18:07] people out of the uh Republicans I House
[18:09] of Republicans to basically to survey in
[18:11] this Administration that means at the
[18:13] moment the Republicans only have a
[18:15] majority of one seat in the House of
[18:17] Representative okay you cannot get
[18:19] anything done in other words in other
[18:22] words at this moment and I would argue
[18:25] for the rest of this year or maybe
[18:26] Beyond Trum canot afford to lose one
[18:30] vote of the freedom caucus okay that's
[18:35] it there're 31 people who literally hold
[18:38] Trump by the whatever you know what I'm
[18:40] talking about yeah I know you're talking
[18:41] about won't use the words but the point
[18:43] here is so these people first of all
[18:45] it's very very now you might say well
[18:47] you know like why haven't these people
[18:48] done anything the last two years because
[18:50] the Republicans did control the house
[18:52] since the midterm election 20 basically
[18:54] 22 the reason is very simple because
[18:57] Mike Johnson the speak of the house okay
[19:00] decided to you know shake hands with the
[19:03] Democrats okay instead of shutting down
[19:06] the government or not raising a debt
[19:08] ceiling as demanded by the freedom
[19:11] caucus this is why the greatest irony of
[19:13] the Republican I think the biggest black
[19:16] mark I think for the Republican party
[19:18] for the house of Republicans for Mike
[19:19] Johnson in particular is that they
[19:22] enable the Republicans that had the
[19:25] majority in the House of Representative
[19:27] enabled a massive spending over the last
[19:30] two years under Biden in a quest to
[19:32] basically win the 2024 elections I mean
[19:35] that's the greatest irony but be ends in
[19:37] May that's over that's history the
[19:39] reality right now is the freedom caucus
[19:42] they literally like you you I mean the
[19:45] Republican Party cannot move right now
[19:47] without having the entire Freedom caucus
[19:50] on board now you might say well what
[19:52] they just basically 31 people like you
[19:54] know like you know do we really care
[19:57] forget about the fact that they are
[19:59] really crucial because every vote counts
[20:01] when you have such a narrow majority but
[20:04] my biggest prediction about 2025 is that
[20:07] I think the freedom caucus is going to
[20:10] go ahead and form a powerful alliance
[20:13] with no other than Elon Musk aha Doge
[20:17] yeah Elon Musk of course as you know is
[20:21] a fiscal Hawk he wants to cut a trillion
[20:23] dollars out of federal spending and
[20:25] guess what Elon MOS does not have too
[20:27] much political
[20:30] okay you know in in US Congress whether
[20:33] Democrats or Republicans think cutting a
[20:35] trillion dollars is going to be bad news
[20:38] for the business of American politics so
[20:40] you could argue the only allies ilam mus
[20:44] truly has you know in US Congress is the
[20:47] freedom caucus okay so from that point
[20:50] of view is a marriage made in heaven the
[20:52] richest men in the most powerful
[20:54] basically political factions in
[20:56] Washington right now are literally about
[20:58] to basically Embrace each other if they
[21:00] haven't done so
[21:01] already the third person I think is very
[21:04] important to consider in this equation
[21:06] of course is Scott bessin who's probably
[21:08] going to go on to become the next
[21:10] treasury secretary and me tell you this
[21:12] I know a little bit about I mean I know
[21:13] Scott I don't know him very very well
[21:15] but you know he's been a client for many
[21:17] years and let me tell you this like
[21:19] every conversation we ever had with
[21:21] Scott okay was about like you know the
[21:24] deficit it was too big the debt was too
[21:27] high and so on so forth would argue
[21:29] there no question my mind you may not
[21:31] know this but Scott Besson is a fiscal
[21:33] Hawk he may be a closet fiscal Hawk
[21:37] because he still needs to get confirmed
[21:38] by Congress okay but he's no doubt a
[21:41] fiscal Hawk okay and and to me the most
[21:44] interesting thing about his nomination
[21:47] by Trump is that why would Trump want to
[21:50] nominate a fiscal Hawk okay as the
[21:53] treasury secretary unless Trump himself
[21:57] is also a fiscal Haw in fact actually
[22:01] was very interesting because Scott did
[22:03] an interview I think with Bloomberg a
[22:05] couple of months ago even before the
[22:06] election which he said well he said well
[22:08] it's very strange because every
[22:10] conversation we're had with Donald Trump
[22:12] is about like every time Donald Trump
[22:14] talk all he wanted to know is well what
[22:16] do we need to do what do we need to do
[22:17] to cut the deficit what do we need to do
[22:19] to bring down the death so what I'm
[22:22] telling you you know it's actually very
[22:23] interesting in American politics because
[22:25] the American political system as such
[22:28] that the impulse is always to run up the
[22:32] deficit the Republicans all they
[22:35] interested is cutting taxes and
[22:37] Democrats all they interested is
[22:39] increasing
[22:40] spending both parties pay Ser lip
[22:42] service to fiscal responsibility but
[22:45] neither really essentially delivers so
[22:49] it really takes an extraordinary
[22:51] combination of circumstances for the US
[22:53] to ever like tighten fiscal spending
[22:56] even by a little bit and I'm telling you
[22:59] right now I think this is one of the
[23:01] rare moments in American history 2025
[23:04] that we might just see this playing out
[23:07] okay okay now nevertheless you might say
[23:09] well
[23:10] David you know this is going to be hard
[23:12] right I mean IL says he's gonna cut he
[23:15] wants to cut a trillion dollars out of
[23:17] US federal spending a year he wants to
[23:19] bring the def deficit down from two
[23:20] trillion to one trillion how do you do
[23:22] that right you know because like you
[23:25] know we know Elon MOS is not an elected
[23:27] official like you know that means that
[23:29] Doge cannot touch mandatory spending
[23:31] like Social Security Medicare Medicare
[23:33] and so on so forth which means that you
[23:35] know the only thing he can touch in
[23:37] theory is discretionary spending now
[23:40] Federal discretionary spending is
[23:42] altogether only 1.8 trillion dollars if
[23:46] you take away defense what you're left
[23:47] with is about a trillion
[23:49] dollars do you think Elon mus is going
[23:51] to be able to cut a trillion dollars out
[23:53] of a trillion dollar total federal
[23:55] spending if he does that we even have
[23:58] have to close down the White House and
[23:59] fire Trump okay so basically that's
[24:02] obviously not possible in my humble
[24:06] opinion the only way you can get to that
[24:08] trillion dollar number you have to go
[24:11] after I'm sorry to say this defense
[24:14] spending now the problem with defense
[24:17] spending I mean I I I don't know how
[24:18] many of your viewers are like die hard
[24:21] Republicans and so on so forth let me
[24:23] tell you this I mean people still ask me
[24:25] oh well the Deep State the D state is
[24:27] gone and they just like from basically
[24:29] like destroy them guess what in my
[24:32] humble opinion the only what remains of
[24:36] the deep states which is also the most
[24:38] powerful core of the deep States is the
[24:42] military industrial
[24:45] complex you're talking about you're
[24:47] talking about $900 billion do that go
[24:51] into defense budget every year out of
[24:54] which half go towards the defense
[24:56] contractors you're talking about these
[24:58] three star generals when they retire
[25:00] they all get parachuted into these like
[25:03] you know defense contractors getting
[25:05] millions of dollars of pay to doing what
[25:07] lobbying for defense contracts you're
[25:10] talking about Mitch McCoo the former
[25:13] Majority Leader having agreed to step
[25:15] down has now appointed himself as the
[25:18] head of the Senate defense budget
[25:22] committee okay you're talking about the
[25:25] fact we're just talking about spending
[25:26] cuts right now just last week the head
[25:29] of the Senate armed services committee
[25:31] was a republican of course okay he just
[25:34] rote out this new plan to increase
[25:37] defense spending by
[25:39] 50% by $500 billion practically now so
[25:44] I'm telling you there's going to be a
[25:46] massive
[25:47] battle between the fiscal Hawks okay
[25:51] that need that want to go after defense
[25:54] spending okay because they realize that
[25:57] is really where the overspending is
[25:59] happening because of the massive cost
[26:01] overruns of US big us contracts and the
[26:05] military industrial complex that is the
[26:09] most powerful basically killing machine
[26:11] in America okay so basically why do you
[26:15] think Trump didn't go anywhere you know
[26:17] after the election he like stayed put in
[26:19] marago practically like he didn't go
[26:21] anywhere he only played golf I think in
[26:23] Mar Lago okay why do you think Elon Musk
[26:26] has stopped taking pot shots at the
[26:27] defense
[26:28] industry over the last month because
[26:31] we're dealing with Killers here you have
[26:32] to understand these killers who think
[26:35] who consider themselves to be the
[26:36] greatest Patriots of America okay who
[26:39] want to keep these wars going for as
[26:40] long as possible who want us to go to
[26:44] World War I because that will be a gold
[26:48] mine okay now this is the reason why I
[26:51] mean Trump cannot afford to take these
[26:53] guys on like head on right so what is
[26:56] Trump so why do you think from like is
[27:02] so committed to ending okay the war in
[27:07] Ukraine do you know I thought very
[27:10] interesting you know the the only thing
[27:12] I mean I I listen to Trump's
[27:13] inauguration speech you know like I you
[27:15] know as you know like I i' sort of like
[27:17] I have this reputation as being Trump's
[27:19] whisper Trump whisper on Wall Street so
[27:22] like you know I nothing he said really
[27:23] surprised me but one thing he said which
[27:26] I think a lot of people didn't pick up
[27:28] on which is like the most important
[27:29] thing he said he said he wanted to be
[27:34] remember okay this is a man who was in
[27:36] his late 70s he's thinking about his
[27:38] legacy in his speech he said he wanted
[27:40] to be
[27:42] remembered as a peacemaker ah do you
[27:46] know who was the last US president who
[27:50] talked about wanting to be a peacemaker
[27:53] in his presidential inauguration speech
[27:56] I couldn't tell you to be honest it was
[27:58] wood Wilson ah in 1913 so pre-or War I
[28:04] yeah on the eve of World War I yeah okay
[28:08] okay so let me tell you this is why
[28:11] Trump understands like this is I mean
[28:13] this is a situation we're in right now
[28:15] right basically like we are pre like
[28:19] again you know the deep I mean the the
[28:21] industrial the military industrial
[28:23] complex is pushing Us in that direction
[28:26] and Trump wants to stop that partly
[28:28] because he needs he wants to extend his
[28:30] tax cuts that's his number one concern
[28:32] and he will have to basically he can
[28:35] certainly cannot allow defense spending
[28:37] to go up if he has any chance of
[28:40] ensuring the US economy doesn't go into
[28:41] recession next year and the reason why
[28:44] he's so adamant that we need to stop the
[28:46] war in Ukraine ASAP is because he knows
[28:50] as long as the Ukraine war is going on
[28:53] he would never be able to stop defense
[28:55] spending because the the Ukraine War has
[28:58] been this gravy train for the US defense
[29:01] industry you think they're going to give
[29:02] it
[29:03] up now no so therefore for Trump World
[29:07] Peace in this case stopping the war in
[29:08] Ukraine I would argue is not just a
[29:11] foreign policy objective in fact is
[29:14] Central to his economic agenda ah okay
[29:19] okay yeah no this is fascinating um C so
[29:22] question for you can he achieve all
[29:26] three of those and when I think okay so
[29:28] extend the tax cuts because honestly I
[29:31] who doesn't I don't like I don't want my
[29:32] taxes to go up I don't know anyone who
[29:34] likes higher taxes um Can going after
[29:38] the defense spining know if I had to
[29:40] think like someone who might understand
[29:42] some of this stuff maybe it is someone
[29:44] like Elon Musk who could I don't know
[29:47] like put some like shed some light on
[29:49] like what where exactly is all the money
[29:51] going and what are the contracts what's
[29:52] really necessary what's not necessary
[29:55] and then can Trump kind of as you point
[29:58] out we're on the brink of World War II
[30:01] can we have peace especially I'm asking
[30:02] you too as someone who's in Israel right
[30:04] now as well so I imagine you have a very
[30:06] interesting perspective yeah exactly the
[30:09] absolutely I mean there's no doubt I
[30:11] mean I mean Elon Musk I mean Elon musos
[30:14] I mean Elon M understands the defense
[30:18] industry because SpaceX the biggest
[30:21] customer is the exactly yeah so Elon M
[30:25] knows everything about the whole you
[30:27] know essentially bidding process for
[30:29] government contracts and what elar says
[30:31] which you know doesn't take a genius to
[30:33] figure out is that the current process
[30:37] doesn't work because of cost overrun for
[30:40] a lot of these projects in fact most US
[30:43] military projects okay you're talking
[30:46] about not like a 20% cost overrun you're
[30:49] talking about 3 to 400% cost overrun
[30:52] you're talking about let's say for
[30:53] example Elam mus has been a big critic
[30:56] of the whole F35
[30:58] program okay because you know what at 35
[31:02] you as one of these airplanes you
[31:04] know that that that was in that was
[31:07] designed to do everything very
[31:10] well guess what and ends up not doing
[31:13] anything very well okay yeah it's a
[31:16] stealth aircraft but it cannot even do
[31:18] dog fights and any given point in time
[31:20] it's like 50% of the F-35 are actually
[31:24] under maintenance because these are very
[31:25] high maintenance plan and about saying
[31:28] like well why why do we even spending
[31:30] hundreds of billion dollars into f35s
[31:33] when the next Wars are going to be
[31:35] fought by drones and Hypersonic missiles
[31:39] like rather than by like a pilot behind
[31:41] a goddamn plane trying to basically do
[31:43] dog fight in here you know this is the
[31:46] most important thing so Elon Musk I
[31:48] think he gets it you and it's very
[31:50] important that Trump has someone like
[31:52] Elon Musk around him who really
[31:54] understands and who's able to tell him
[31:57] the truth now
[31:58] it doesn't mean that El M can stop the
[32:00] war Ukraine because Trump because I can
[32:02] tell you one thing you know what you
[32:05] know because as far as I'm concerned the
[32:07] Trump presidency really started the day
[32:09] after the election because Trump wasn't
[32:11] like waiting for the inauguration was
[32:12] not like he went on a holiday for the
[32:14] last two months the guy has been busy
[32:16] working the last two months because he
[32:18] wanted to be like ready to go off the
[32:20] gate like right out the gate okay let me
[32:23] tell you this the Trump team has been
[32:26] engaging okay in conversations with a
[32:29] lot of very important world leaders and
[32:31] trying to resolve conflicts before he
[32:33] even becomes president because just
[32:35] think about this right it's much easier
[32:37] to have these conversations before your
[32:39] your presidency begins than afterwards
[32:41] you know because before your presidency
[32:43] begins like these are casual
[32:45] conversations you know that the New York
[32:47] Times is not going to blast you over it
[32:49] and so on so forth so there's a lot of
[32:51] things you can talk about now let me
[32:52] tell you this the conversation between
[32:55] the Trump team and the Russians
[32:58] has not gone as well as hoped it is very
[33:01] clear now I'm not telling you because I
[33:03] have any information but if you read
[33:05] between the lines it's very obvious this
[33:07] is what's going on okay Trump just last
[33:10] week revised his timeline for ending the
[33:12] war in Ukraine from 24 hours to now
[33:15] maybe six months or maybe even longer
[33:18] okay now why why did the conversation
[33:22] not go so well this is notwithstanding
[33:25] the fact that potin is sounding very
[33:27] enthusiastic about meeting Trump he
[33:29] wants to talk to Trump and but what is
[33:32] it about basically the conversation over
[33:35] the last two months that it hasn't gone
[33:37] as well as plan well let me tell you
[33:39] something I mean again this is very
[33:41] important like you know because as you
[33:45] probably know Trump has floated this you
[33:47] know peace proposal and one element of
[33:50] this peace
[33:51] proposal okay was seen by the Russian as
[33:54] like a red line it's like the Russians
[33:56] you know like as much as they like Trump
[33:58] they said you know thank you but no
[33:59] thank you this we cannot accept now you
[34:02] said well which part of that
[34:04] proposal okay you might have read about
[34:06] this but the US Trump says you know what
[34:08] let's let the Russians keep the
[34:10] territory they already you know
[34:11] basically are already under Russian
[34:13] control okay but what in within Ukraine
[34:16] what he wants to do is to create a
[34:17] buffer zone that will be patrolled by
[34:21] British and French
[34:23] troops now for the Russians that's like
[34:27] no sorry and the reason is very simple
[34:31] because for the Russians okay having
[34:35] NATO troops on his border even inside a
[34:39] neutral zone is no different in practice
[34:42] than having Ukraine inside
[34:46] NATO Russia fought this war invaded
[34:50] Ukraine in order to stop Ukraine from
[34:53] joining NATO you think Putin after
[34:56] having you know lost the lives of a
[34:58] 100,000 young men are going to say yeah
[35:00] let's bring on the basically NATO troops
[35:02] and put them on our
[35:04] border okay so I think again this is not
[35:07] about whether you like Putin what you
[35:08] don't like Putin we are all capable of
[35:11] putting ourselves in the brain of
[35:14] somebody else even someone we don't like
[35:17] just as that we can figure out because
[35:18] my job is to figure out for my clients
[35:20] what's going to be the next move what's
[35:22] Trump's next move what's Putin's next
[35:23] move how do you invest your money
[35:24] accordingly and what I'm telling you is
[35:27] that it OB that this is something that
[35:30] the Russians will never accept I mean no
[35:33] matter how much they like Trump they can
[35:35] accept this especially given there is
[35:38] huge and profound mistrust in the United
[35:41] States and in NATO well and some of that
[35:44] distrust is completely understandable
[35:47] let me just give you one example
[35:49] okay so you know in
[35:52] 2022 Angela Merkel the former chancellor
[35:56] of Germany okay admitted in a public
[36:00] interview that Germany and France signed
[36:03] the Minsk agreement in 2014 with Russia
[36:06] over Ukraine only to buy time for
[36:10] Ukraine to build up his armed forces in
[36:12] his military strength that they never
[36:14] intended to honor that
[36:17] agreement so this is not the Russian
[36:19] saying this this is the former German
[36:21] Chancellor saying this about why she
[36:24] signed the Minsk agreement okay you
[36:27] think the Russians after what happened
[36:29] the last 10 years with trust NATO and
[36:32] the Americans and the Europeans and so
[36:34] on so forth I mean again if you send a
[36:37] 100,000 people to die in the battlefield
[36:41] you have to be able to tell the mothers
[36:43] the fathers of these young men like you
[36:45] know what they did it for
[36:47] something and you're not thinking oh wow
[36:50] I can trust Trump so like let's just
[36:52] basically go with what he says okay
[36:54] we'll buy peace for the next four years
[36:56] because if you're the Russians you it's
[36:57] a civilization be gone for like you know
[36:59] 1,500 years they're thinking like
[37:02] they're not thinking the next four years
[37:03] they're thinking about the next 10 maybe
[37:05] 20 years now so from that point of view
[37:08] this is a problem which is that the
[37:11] Russians especially given that the
[37:12] Russians right now have the upper hand
[37:14] in the battlefield over Ukraine and they
[37:18] they see no reason why they need to end
[37:19] the war anyway right away because you
[37:22] know their bargaining power the way they
[37:24] see is only going to go up you know as
[37:27] basic basically spring and summer
[37:28] arrives which will accelerate there then
[37:30] you know because right now like every
[37:32] half of Ukraine is BU under snow right
[37:34] now okay but the point here is this it's
[37:37] actually interesting so what I'm telling
[37:39] you is that the Russian the Ukraine war
[37:42] is very likely to be decided by it will
[37:46] be decided in the battlefield rather
[37:48] than by
[37:50] diplomacy the only question in my mind
[37:53] right now which is the biggest question
[37:54] on which should be the the biggest
[37:57] question on your mind if you care about
[37:59] markets well you care about war politics
[38:01] and so on so forth it doesn't really
[38:02] matter it's like well Will
[38:04] trump decide to sit back and just let
[38:07] the war play
[38:09] out or Will trump decide Bic come under
[38:13] pressure to try to delay the
[38:17] inevitable like yesterday for example
[38:19] Trump say oh wow I'm going to hit Russia
[38:22] with new sanctions tarff I'm telling you
[38:26] no I don't know why he said what he said
[38:29] okay well I have no idea is does he
[38:32] really mean it okay because if he means
[38:34] it then this this whole situation is
[38:36] very bad because all the tariffs because
[38:39] Biden has already slapped every possible
[38:41] tariff and sanction on Russia and didn't
[38:43] work didn't work if Trump would to go
[38:45] down that same path and Trump wants to
[38:47] do everything bigger and bigger and
[38:48] bigger and he cannot take failure for
[38:50] answer like we're talking about World
[38:52] War I or is it possible that Trump said
[38:56] what he said to
[38:58] tocate to buy some time with the
[39:02] military industrial complex so to make
[39:05] sure that his boy Pete HAF basically
[39:08] sails through the confirmation which
[39:10] could be actually today or
[39:11] tomorrow okay okay so we don't know
[39:14] what's going on here but what I'm saying
[39:15] to you is that you know you know I you
[39:19] know Trump I have no doubt that Trump
[39:21] wants to bring back world peace and then
[39:23] because he's the first president since
[39:25] Jimmy Carter who did not enter US troops
[39:28] into new basic foreign conflicts so
[39:30] Trump has a track record that you know
[39:32] that he could brag about okay and and
[39:34] that gives him a lot of credibility in
[39:35] my eyes but I think that you know so
[39:38] much blood has already been spilled that
[39:40] right now it's sort of like I think on
[39:42] the Ukraine situation I think is an
[39:45] impossible situation right now and this
[39:48] ironically
[39:49] Julia okay opens an opportunity for the
[39:53] US and China to work out the differences
[39:57] because Trump knows I've been thinking
[40:00] for the last six weeks I've been like
[40:02] debating myself so who is Trump going to
[40:04] meet first is it going to be shiin ping
[40:06] or is going to be basically Putin at
[40:07] this point it's very clear it's going to
[40:09] be xiin ping interesting because the
[40:11] only person in the whole entire world
[40:13] who's got some leverage over Putin it's
[40:15] basically the only country that has any
[40:18] kind of Leverage over Russia is China
[40:21] right just like Ukraine wants security
[40:24] guarantee from the United States to
[40:27] accept the peace deal Russia also wants
[40:30] security guarantee except the US cannot
[40:32] obviously offer security guarantee to
[40:35] Russia the only country that can is
[40:37] China China
[40:39] okay that's it that's why us and China
[40:42] will have to
[40:43] co-sponsor the peace agreement which
[40:46] whenever that's going to come and that's
[40:48] the reason why Trum needs to do a deal
[40:52] on Tik Tok and this is why he wants to
[40:54] do do a deal on Tik Tok not only is
[40:56] because it's relatively straightforward
[40:58] deal but because he needs to get back to
[41:00] the negotiation table with the Chinese
[41:02] to get the conversation going again okay
[41:05] so that because and it's not you know
[41:07] this is why you got to think you're
[41:09] dealing with Trump who is a not only a
[41:12] chess player but he's very good at
[41:14] playing multi-dimensional chess yeah
[41:16] yeah yeah we're playing like 3D chess
[41:18] here okay and there is no question that
[41:20] this time around he is so much more
[41:22] prepared it's like I have not except I
[41:25] mean he has not made I mean let's put it
[41:28] this way I mean the last two months he
[41:29] had many opportunities to say stupid
[41:31] things that kind of thing he has not
[41:33] said one stupid thing like it tells me
[41:36] that he's absolutely like he's got his
[41:39] eye on the ball he knows like he's got
[41:42] the SEC like thinking like two steps
[41:44] ahead three steps ahead five steps ahead
[41:47] he's got the whole plan a plan B plan C
[41:50] so I I would say right now I I'm feeling
[41:53] quite good but again nevertheless what I
[41:56] just told you is not going to be that
[41:58] straightforward the only straightforward
[42:00] part about his agenda is going to be
[42:01] about border security that that is going
[42:04] to be done and this also the reason why
[42:06] of all the major currencies to own I'm
[42:09] so incredibly bullish on the Mexican
[42:10] pesel because like the Mex Mexico is g
[42:14] to be Mexico is going to be Trump's best
[42:17] friend and I'll tell you that if you're
[42:18] interested and this is why I think I'm
[42:20] very bullish on Mexico by the way okay
[42:23] much whereas in contrast I'm extremely
[42:25] bearish on Canada by the way okay but in
[42:28] general we have to think about the way
[42:31] you going to think about you know how to
[42:33] make money if you want to if if that's
[42:35] your thing okay and that's why you're
[42:36] following your show is like especially
[42:40] if you're a currency Trader investor you
[42:42] thinking about which countries are going
[42:44] to be winners and losers the way you got
[42:46] to think about this is which countries
[42:48] are going to get the best deals out of
[42:50] trump yeah now to the extent that right
[42:53] now everybody is like there's a huge
[42:55] line outside White House of foreign
[42:57] leaders were trying to get in to Shake
[42:59] in with Trump and sign a deal yeah
[43:01] because everybody knows whoever is going
[43:03] to be the last one it's going to get the
[43:06] most rotten deal so everybody's trying
[43:08] to get to the front of the line and let
[43:09] me tell you this Mexico right now is in
[43:12] front of everybody else like way ahead
[43:15] and we'll talk about that in second I
[43:16] want to come back to Mexico but can I
[43:19] first go back to China real quick yes
[43:20] please okay because you mentioned like
[43:22] he needs to get the ticktock deal that's
[43:24] kind of interesting from a geopolitical
[43:25] perspective but also when I think of
[43:28] China tariffs as well but if China could
[43:31] be super important in achieving peace
[43:35] between Russia and Ukraine like can you
[43:36] kind of walk us through what are the
[43:37] chess moves there because that's
[43:40] interesting and then I want I do want to
[43:41] come back to Mexico and Canada because
[43:42] that is interesting too I think you know
[43:46] listen you know it's actually fun you
[43:48] know as you know I've got my own YouTube
[43:50] channel it's like whenever I put out a
[43:52] new video I'm either either accused as
[43:56] being you know essentially the uh
[43:58] working on behalf of uh the Chinese
[44:00] Communist Party would that people call
[44:02] me like U America's dog or something
[44:06] like that you know it's actually very
[44:07] interesting people see me as either
[44:09] being too pro-american or pro-china the
[44:12] truth is I'm neither okay like I was
[44:15] born in Pittsburgh I grew up in Taiwan
[44:18] my parents ran away from the Communist
[44:20] Revolution in China okay they were born
[44:22] in Shanghai you know I was educated for
[44:24] the most part in the US I half my
[44:27] working career was in Europe I got to
[44:29] the top I was the most successful Asian
[44:32] guy at Bank of America probably
[44:36] everist I not live in Israel I know my
[44:38] in Jewish so like my background I think
[44:41] like I I you should not suspect of my
[44:44] ideological coloring because I have none
[44:46] I mean the only country I've you know
[44:48] I'm very patriotic about right now is
[44:49] Israel because I've got five
[44:50] grandchildren here living in Israel so
[44:52] Israel is very important to me but
[44:54] everybody else sort of is about the same
[44:56] I would say but what I'm interested is
[44:59] what I'm much more interested is you
[45:02] know is which country is smart in which
[45:06] country is
[45:08] stupid right because like I'm I'm I'm as
[45:11] I said D I'm I'm I'm I'm a professor
[45:13] here in Israel like I teach on the side
[45:16] and then I um I teach Game Theory oh
[45:19] there you go that's interesting think
[45:21] about yeah I Love Game Theory because in
[45:23] Game Theory there's no mother Tera
[45:25] there's no Adam Hitler they're only good
[45:27] players and bad players okay and just
[45:30] happens to be the case that Trump is a
[45:32] very good player okay and so from that
[45:35] point it's just like Biden was a
[45:36] terrible player and I'm not even I think
[45:39] I think sh ping is not a very good
[45:40] player either I think Putin however is
[45:42] at the same level as Trump as a chess
[45:44] player okay so again that's the way I
[45:46] see the world which is like there are
[45:49] chess players and there are Checker
[45:50] players and then what interests me is
[45:53] how do they play against each other and
[45:55] what are the consequences for the world
[45:56] and what are the consequences for
[45:58] financial markets because you know this
[45:59] is what I do for a living now let's
[46:02] think about Trump for a moment okay you
[46:06] know it's interesting I said before like
[46:08] Trump's emphasis on world peace makes
[46:11] him the first since wooder Wilson okay
[46:14] now wood Wilson in case you know people
[46:17] follow your show don't know wood Wilson
[46:19] was literally like the father of
[46:22] American idealism in foreign policy
[46:25] right I mean wood Wilson was the guy who
[46:27] wanted to create the league of nation if
[46:29] you recall like he was you know and when
[46:32] I'm talking about idealism in American
[46:34] policy what I really mean is this idea
[46:37] it's elevating
[46:39] democracy Liberty and human rights to
[46:42] the sort of to put it above everything
[46:45] else okay by the way Thomas Jefferson
[46:47] isn't look at it that way George
[46:49] Washington not look at it that way but
[46:51] yet it's interesting because four years
[46:53] ago when you listen to the uh the the
[46:55] Senate testimony okay for his
[46:58] confirmation Anthony blinkin did you
[47:00] know the um the uh the Secretary of
[47:03] State under Biden he spent a lot of time
[47:06] talking about promoting democracy abroad
[47:09] as a major foreign policy goal which he
[47:13] went on talking about for the last four
[47:14] years okay now if you listen to what
[47:17] Marco Rubio said last week was actually
[47:20] very interesting because Marco Rubio
[47:23] views China as a dangerous rivalry
[47:25] that's what he said but he did not frame
[47:29] the Rival in ideological terms he can't
[47:33] give a he can't give a damn about China
[47:35] being an authoritarian state that is
[47:38] okay so from that point of view this is
[47:40] very important because Trum does not
[47:42] view the world through the lens of
[47:45] democracies versus authoritarianism good
[47:48] versus evil okay that's a very big
[47:51] difference between Trump and most of the
[47:53] presidents 90% of the president since W
[47:55] Wilson with the exception of rich
[47:56] Richard Nixon but Richard Nixon of
[47:58] course you know who was the first
[48:00] realist in US foreign policy since SC
[48:04] knows when he was the one who was the
[48:07] first guy go to China actually the US
[48:10] president who broke the eyes for the
[48:12] Chinese now Trump is a realist what make
[48:17] what sets Trump apart is like he so he's
[48:20] not an idealist he's a realist and
[48:22] moreover from is interested and he's
[48:25] he's he he is only interested in one
[48:27] thing which is doing a deal now I'm not
[48:31] saying that you know you can do a deal
[48:34] out of everything clearly there are a
[48:36] lot of things that cannot you know that
[48:39] that that that's beyond even Trump in
[48:41] terms of reaching a deal with the
[48:43] Chinese because there's no doubt the US
[48:45] and China are going to remain strategic
[48:46] rival for the next 50 years there's no
[48:49] doubt about that but within that
[48:52] basically you know within that okay
[48:55] framework I mean there's still a lot of
[48:58] things you can do that are on the table
[49:00] that will represent win-win for both
[49:02] sides okay what Trump understands is
[49:07] that a deal is better than a no
[49:09] deal but a deal requires that there is
[49:12] something for both sides and that's it
[49:15] so whereas Biden saw the world glass
[49:18] half empty to the extent he saw the
[49:20] world in terms of a one giant zero some
[49:24] game anybody who loses means somebody
[49:26] else will lose will win Trump sees the
[49:29] world in terms of opportunity of
[49:31] creating win-wins now if you look at Tik
[49:33] Tok is a very good example I mean Tik
[49:35] Tok is a great example in Z in fact Tik
[49:38] Tok is such an easy problem that it
[49:40] makes like almost everything else Trump
[49:41] is going to do look like a total like
[49:46] layup because think about this a lot of
[49:49] Americans don't realize this so Tik Tok
[49:52] as we all know is on B bite dance bite
[49:56] dance
[49:57] is a company headquartered in
[49:59] China however if you look at the
[50:01] ownership structure of bite dance okay
[50:05] 20% of bite dance is owned by bite dance
[50:10] management another 20% is owned by bite
[50:13] dance
[50:16] employees the other 60% in other words
[50:19] majority of bite dance is owned by Black
[50:23] Rock Carla group and General Anthony
[50:27] in other words American
[50:30] investors so when you close down bite
[50:34] dance or Tik Tok whatever it is what
[50:36] you're doing is really like destroying
[50:38] American sh shareholder value as opposed
[50:41] to whatever China so from that point of
[50:44] view to begin with I mean this is a
[50:46] country that's already majority owned by
[50:48] the Americans that already makes it so
[50:51] much easier okay so now the only
[50:54] question is Trump says W 50/50 which I
[50:56] think makes a lot of sense right I mean
[50:57] who's going to be stepping up to play
[51:00] you know buying off let's say you know
[51:02] what's going to end up happening I think
[51:04] is that a strategic investor is going to
[51:08] basically buy the shares from the likes
[51:11] of Black Rock carine group and uh
[51:14] General atantic okay American shoulders
[51:17] and who could be that person it could be
[51:19] Elon Musk no doubt about that El MOS
[51:21] would be would be an obvious solution
[51:23] another person is actually interesting
[51:25] enough Larry Allison because Larry
[51:27] Allison you saw he was house two days
[51:32] ago yeah Stargate and what because Larry
[51:35] Allison you know I'm sure like he
[51:38] doesn't like he doesn't like the fact
[51:40] that he's been left out you know by the
[51:43] so whoever framed the you know basically
[51:45] the Magnificent 7 right I mean you could
[51:47] argue like oraco is the second largest
[51:48] software company after Microsoft
[51:50] everybody's talking about magnes s
[51:52] Oracle gets nothing and this is why
[51:54] Oracle wants to buy a ticket to get back
[51:57] into the game and you know you know this
[51:59] is why they want to go into the uh Data
[52:00] Center business to take a whack at the
[52:03] gross margin enjoy by by Microsoft but
[52:05] the point here is this Oracle
[52:09] already houses because Oracle is a it's
[52:12] a databased company they already have a
[52:15] deal with Tik Tok to store all the
[52:18] information about Tik Tok users in the
[52:21] US by
[52:23] Oracle okay so Larry Allison to me is
[52:27] the logical person to to be the US
[52:29] shareholder in this okay so so it
[52:32] doesn't really matter but but my point
[52:34] here is to say Tik Tok actually
[52:36] relatively speaking is actually the
[52:38] easiest problem to solve okay so I think
[52:43] you know so that's why I think Tik Tock
[52:46] you know I see Tik Tok as an opportunity
[52:49] it's literally about confidence building
[52:51] because right now you need to get a deal
[52:53] going so that people move on to the next
[52:55] thing and I've always said you know like
[52:56] I'm a trade Economist you know I've got
[52:58] a PhD in economics from Columbia
[53:00] University I did my PhD in international
[53:03] trade and then I went on to the
[53:04] international monetary fund where I
[53:05] worked for many years so you know to a
[53:07] great extent you can call me an
[53:08] international trade expert and let me
[53:10] tell you the phase one agreement signed
[53:12] between Trump and the Chinese back in
[53:15] 2020 it's one of the best trade
[53:17] agreements ever signed between two
[53:18] countries I'm probably the only one you
[53:20] know every been on the show or probably
[53:22] only person you know on Wall Street
[53:23] who's actually read that phase one
[53:25] agreement 103 pages of it back to back
[53:28] like three times okay and let me tell
[53:31] you this it was a great deal because it
[53:33] was a win-win for both sides okay now it
[53:36] was interesting and I've been saying
[53:38] this for many for for many months that
[53:40] Trump because that was a great deal and
[53:42] even at the time Trump says well I was
[53:44] the greatest deal ever you know you know
[53:47] how Trump talks this is why it's very
[53:49] logical for Trump to want to return to
[53:51] the phase one agreement as a starting
[53:54] point of any further their negotiations
[53:57] and interestingly on Monday he issued an
[54:01] executive order you know in which he's
[54:04] actually ordering uh an assessment of
[54:07] where things stand Visa the face one
[54:09] agreement what has China done what
[54:12] hasn't China done what's been the
[54:13] compliance and so on so forth so I can
[54:16] already tell you what the first thing
[54:18] Trump is going to say to Xi Jinping when
[54:20] they do meet I just say in
[54:23] China under the phase one agreement the
[54:26] Chinese promis the us that they will
[54:29] spend an extra $200 billion on us goods
[54:33] and services in 2020 and
[54:37] 2021 which of course never happened
[54:39] because of
[54:40] Co I have no doubt like the first thing
[54:43] Trump is gonna say to Shin ping is like
[54:45] she where's my $200
[54:49] billion okay well I mean you know joking
[54:52] aside I I actually think this will be a
[54:54] very Ser this will be a very key part of
[54:56] any agreement by the way okay because
[54:59] what because for for for for Trump and
[55:02] he's absolutely right money can solve a
[55:04] lot of
[55:05] problem okay so Bea is a m so so what
[55:08] I'm telling you is that that's why this
[55:11] us China thing I think you
[55:14] know I think you know I think Trump was
[55:17] right I mean it's very very interesting
[55:19] and I think you know by the way let me
[55:21] tell you something else I many of your
[55:23] viewers I guarantee them I guarantee you
[55:25] they don't know which which is this so
[55:28] Trump was invited by China by Shi
[55:30] Jinping okay to visit China in
[55:33] 2017 okay so this was the first time CH
[55:37] was the was the first time the only time
[55:40] that Trump went to China was in 2017 as
[55:43] president of course I think he's been to
[55:45] China before that he went to China in
[55:48] 2017 to meet xiin ping and Sh ping like
[55:52] threw you know threw open the forbidden
[55:55] palace okay organized this like banquet
[55:58] for Trump that China's never ever done
[56:01] okay for to receive a visiting head of
[56:03] state okay like you know this was like
[56:06] just to give you a sense of like how
[56:08] much importance China attached to this
[56:10] particular visit and believe me there
[56:11] have been plent of other American
[56:13] president who went to China before we
[56:14] never got the red carbet treatment the
[56:16] way that Trump got and I think part of
[56:18] the story was that Trump that the Shing
[56:20] ping wanted the impress on Trump like
[56:24] China's got you know a history 4,000
[56:27] years were like a great people the
[56:29] history and all
[56:30] that you know what Trump did like you
[56:33] know as they were sitting down at the
[56:34] dinner table Trump said well president
[56:37] she I brought a president for you so she
[56:40] says well so what's the president okay
[56:43] so Trump had Secret Service roll in this
[56:45] big TV okay and they beam in Trump's
[56:49] granddaughter
[56:51] ivanka's daughter from New York seven
[56:54] years old Arabella
[56:56] and this little girl of seven spent the
[57:00] next half an hour reciting imperfectly
[57:03] pronounced Chinese okay a 2,500 year old
[57:08] Confucian text from Pure
[57:11] memory and let me tell you this like she
[57:14] like I saw like he was I'm sure like he
[57:16] was completely shocked like you might
[57:18] like you know I have me tell you this
[57:20] went totally like you know viral in
[57:22] China because like the message from
[57:24] Trump is like well so you you know yeah
[57:27] you know you you know you know you want
[57:30] to teach me about China we already know
[57:32] quite a bit about China I think that was
[57:35] the message to the extent that listen
[57:37] believe me Trump's granddaughter didn't
[57:39] get ready for that thing in the space of
[57:41] a week because his grandfather was about
[57:43] her grandfather was about to go off to
[57:45] China okay I mean clearly like you know
[57:49] you know what I'm telling you is that
[57:52] Trump is a man of many talents and he
[57:56] much more sophisticated than most
[57:58] Americans give him credit for and he's
[58:00] very deep and if there's anybody who can
[58:04] basically you know try to work something
[58:06] out with the Chinese so that it's a
[58:08] win-win for everybody I think it's going
[58:10] to be Trump especially with the help of
[58:12] Elon Musk because Elon musk's biggest
[58:14] Factory in the world car factory is in
[58:16] China his SEC his biggest battery
[58:19] Factory in the world he's now building
[58:21] in China nobody sends to lose more than
[58:24] Elon Musk if us and China with to
[58:27] go so there you have it interesting okay
[58:31] let's say that um he's able to work out
[58:34] some sort of deal what what would that
[58:36] mean from an investing perspective would
[58:38] that that create opportunities to invest
[58:40] in China from your point of you I'm
[58:43] right now Lo Chinese stocks okay I I've
[58:45] started buying some Chinese stocks last
[58:46] week I mean I only
[58:48] started okay I think like um I think
[58:51] Friday Friday was last Friday so it's a
[58:53] week ago Friday whatever the day before
[58:56] inauguration you know I thought like
[58:58] because everybody was saying oh well
[58:59] Trump is going to impose massive Terror
[59:02] on China on his first day I said no way
[59:05] so I got ahead of that and I bought some
[59:07] Chinese equities of course I've been
[59:09] right okay so I like Chinese equities
[59:11] but again this is for me it's a trade as
[59:13] whatever who knows what's going to
[59:15] happen but for the time being it seems
[59:17] to me that you know like the US Stock
[59:19] Market is pretty expensive the Chinese
[59:22] stock market in contrast is pretty cheap
[59:24] so I like owning some Chinese stocks
[59:25] here you know on the assumption that you
[59:27] know the relationship will be improved
[59:29] now don't get me wrong I mean I don't
[59:30] think it's going to go up in a straight
[59:31] line I told you already like the Trump
[59:33] presidency 2.0 is gonna be it's it's
[59:35] full it's Litter with difficulties by
[59:37] the way okay but nevertheless I kind of
[59:40] feel like it's you know if you I think
[59:42] it's you know especially if you're long
[59:44] goal if you think if you're long goal is
[59:45] because you think that World War II is
[59:47] gonna break out okay now if you don't
[59:49] think World War 3 is going to break out
[59:51] then you probably can do worse they're
[59:53] owning some Chinese stocks fxi which
[59:56] which is the uh the ETF of which is
[59:58] Chinese stocks large cap Chinese stocks
[60:00] traded in Hong Kong I mean that's the
[60:01] ETF I you know that's traded on in the
[60:03] US I kind of like that um at least as a
[60:06] small part of my portfolio do you want
[60:08] to own gold as like a hedge in case we
[60:10] are on that Brink or something goes Ary
[60:13] and we don't see World Peace are you are
[60:15] you someone I mean certainly it's
[60:16] possible listen I mean I I think I I
[60:18] mean for me gold is I'm trading in and
[60:20] out of gold I'm not like you know I'm
[60:22] not a buy to hold gold guy okay because
[60:26] I want to believe if Trump succeeds like
[60:29] you know the geopolitical risk Prem is
[60:31] too high so I I mean in some sense my
[60:34] investment also is colored by my bias my
[60:37] bias is that I'm hoping that Trump will
[60:39] be successful in terms of you know
[60:41] saying should be bring peace back to the
[60:43] world but there's no doubt like if
[60:45] things don't work out with the Russians
[60:48] if like if the Deep stay as I said
[60:49] before if the military if what I'm
[60:52] worried about the most bullish thing for
[60:54] gold is the US military industrial
[60:59] complex these people won World War II
[61:02] and they're going to do everything to
[61:03] stop Trump and Elon Musk they won
[61:06] forever Wars everywhere in the world and
[61:09] those are the people that I would say if
[61:12] if you want to buy
[61:13] gold that's the reason why you're buying
[61:16] gold for no other reason in my humble
[61:18] opinion right now yeah um okay I want to
[61:21] kind of come back to this part of the
[61:24] world like us because you mentioned our
[61:26] neighbors you are bearish on Canada but
[61:29] you're bullish on Mexico specifically
[61:31] the Mexican peso can you frame up your
[61:35] thesis there um I imagine this has to do
[61:37] with borders as well um there's some
[61:40] political changes happening like
[61:42] Trudeau's out um so let's just kind of
[61:44] frame up this uh you know kind of North
[61:47] American uh if you will I think you know
[61:50] as I said before like right now like the
[61:53] winners and losers of trump 2.0 is going
[61:57] to be who's going to get to the line in
[61:59] terms of signing the first deal with
[62:01] Trump like countries are going to be
[62:03] proactive they're going to do well
[62:05] countries are reactive are going to do
[62:06] poorly now if I look at Mexico versus
[62:10] Canada they're like the opposite end of
[62:12] the extreme right now let me tell you
[62:15] two days after Trump won the election
[62:18] okay he did a call with Claudia sharmar
[62:20] you know the president of
[62:22] Mexico two days after that conversation
[62:25] Mexico swoop down and sees a ton of
[62:29] fento which is equivalent to about 200
[62:32] million pills okay which is a record
[62:36] seizure like anywhere in the world okay
[62:39] over the last six weeks Mexico has
[62:42] arrested more than 6,000 drug dealers
[62:45] because they know that Trump was going
[62:46] to go ahead and label Mexican drug
[62:49] cartels as terrorist
[62:51] organizations over the last four weeks
[62:54] Mexico has been cracking down down on
[62:57] counterfeit Chinese Goods in Mexico on
[62:59] their way to the US like all the
[63:01] whatever the fake Gucci bags what fig
[63:04] Rolex Watcher that you find on you know
[63:07] Canal Street that enter the US from
[63:09] Mexico that ultimately come from China
[63:11] Mexico is cracking down in a big way in
[63:14] fact they're revamping their entire
[63:15] custom system to bring it in compliance
[63:19] with
[63:20] usmca on top of that you know what
[63:23] Claudia shinan say something last week
[63:24] that I almost fell off the chair when I
[63:26] heard it this means that the Mexicans
[63:30] really smart by the way Claudia shamban
[63:32] is probably the only heads of state
[63:33] today anywhere in the world it's got
[63:35] actually PhD this it's a very very smart
[63:37] woman she said that Mexico is willing to
[63:41] consider the possibility the possibility
[63:44] of taking in non-mexican deportees from
[63:49] the US when I heard that I was like wow
[63:52] you know this woman is too smart because
[63:55] you know
[63:56] what what people a lot of Americans
[63:58] don't realize is that of the 12 million
[64:01] 15 million however many illegal you know
[64:04] people who enter the US under Biden okay
[64:08] less than 20% of them are from
[64:11] Mexico 80% of them are like from
[64:14] Venezuela Colombia Panama you know you
[64:18] know Guatemala wherever they come from
[64:20] they're not from Mexico now Trump wants
[64:22] to deport 1 million
[64:24] people do you really think that the
[64:27] president of Ven Willam Maduro is going
[64:29] to say Trump I love you send them back
[64:31] especially the hardcore criminals send
[64:33] them back all back you think Panama is
[64:36] gonna say well Trump you know listen
[64:38] we'll give you the canal and send back
[64:40] all the criminals back to Panama we'll
[64:41] take them back there L of course not no
[64:45] the fact that the Mexicans are willing
[64:47] to take in non-mexican Deportes is like
[64:51] I have to say it's like a it's like it's
[64:53] like it's like Mexico holding for Aces
[64:56] at a poker game I mean literally it
[64:58] doesn't get better than that by the way
[65:00] okay because literally Trump's B
[65:03] policies at the mercy of Mexico's dep
[65:08] Mexico's cooperation and then the fact
[65:10] that they're even saying that they're
[65:12] willing to consider means that they are
[65:14] flexible enough that they like Trump are
[65:19] us are willing to look at a deal in
[65:22] which there's a price for everything
[65:25] okay so from that point of view when
[65:27] Trump basically came out and said three
[65:29] days ago that he was that he's giving
[65:31] Mexico and Canada until like February
[65:33] 1st to make up their mind before he hit
[65:36] them with tariff I think TR mentally has
[65:38] already prepared that nothing's gonna
[65:41] happen to Mexico because Mexicans have
[65:44] already made a lot of progress that's my
[65:46] view Canada on the other hand okay has
[65:50] done zero okay in terms of even meeting
[65:53] Trump like forget about halfway even
[65:55] like 10% of the way if you recall
[65:58] following Shin Bon's call with Trump
[66:00] trau flew down to marago to bend his
[66:03] knee but the most important thing the
[66:06] next day trudo's Deputy Prime Minister
[66:09] chrisa
[66:10] Freeland resigned in protest I'm telling
[66:14] you if there's a tough woman that is
[66:16] this chrisa frand woman she was like a
[66:19] nightmare okay during the you know
[66:22] renegotiation of usmca back in 2018 she
[66:26] was an obstructionist okay she hates
[66:28] Trump by the way totally hates Trump not
[66:30] that surprising okay she's Canadian and
[66:32] she's a woman and she's Progressive
[66:34] right so the point here is that
[66:37] she now that Trudeau has resigned
[66:40] there's now a leadership race to replace
[66:43] him obvious at this point it looks like
[66:45] it's Mark Carney versus Christia
[66:47] Freeland and Christia Freeland is
[66:50] campaigning on let's stick it to Trump
[66:54] okay if hits us with tariff we're going
[66:56] to basically hit him back with more
[66:58] tariffs okay what I'm telling you is
[67:01] that this is very unhelpful so while you
[67:04] know two women both dealing with Trump
[67:07] what the Mexican women is like moving at
[67:09] the speed of life to try to meet Trump
[67:11] like more than halfway and trying to you
[67:13] know trying to get a deal done the
[67:15] Canadian woman is like literally about
[67:18] you know it's literally talking very
[67:20] belligerently and ones to basically
[67:22] fighting to death so this is why you
[67:26] know the situation doesn't look for
[67:27] Canada at least in the time being now
[67:29] whether Freeland is going to win the
[67:31] leadership race I don't know but all I
[67:33] know is that the general elections in
[67:35] Canada will not be held until October at
[67:38] the earliest I think once that elections
[67:41] held I'll be much more relaxed because
[67:42] the conservatives right now look like
[67:44] they are you know they're they're set to
[67:46] win by a landslide and then the
[67:48] conservatives in can they think like
[67:50] Trump so I I don't think there's going
[67:51] to be a problem there okay but right now
[67:54] the problem is February 1 deadline that
[67:57] Trump has said and while I attach a very
[68:01] low probability that Mexico is going to
[68:03] be hit with the Tariff I attach a very
[68:05] high probability that Canada will not be
[68:07] able to escape this and therefore at
[68:10] least for the next eight days I like B I
[68:13] like buying the Mexican peso versus
[68:15] Canadian dollar okay got it well um I
[68:18] know we're at time here and I'm going to
[68:20] have to get you back on at um sooner
[68:22] than later if you're open to it cuz we
[68:24] love having you on because we didn't
[68:26] really go too deep into Europe or
[68:28] anything but I know we'll have the
[68:29] election in Germany and I think that's
[68:30] February 23rd so maybe in a month we'll
[68:32] have to get you back on to kind of
[68:33] reassess that part of the world too but
[68:36] um I've really enjoyed this conversation
[68:39] you mentioned like Chinese stocks the
[68:41] Mexican peso you briefly mentioned
[68:43] markets here in the US um overvalued
[68:46] what's kind of your take on just more of
[68:47] the US market situation I actually
[68:50] believe or not I actually like owning
[68:51] fiveyear treasuries I actually think
[68:54] that five year treasury is going to be a
[68:55] decent trade now of course you know
[68:57] there there is a sort of a lever way to
[68:59] play this and there unlever way of
[69:00] playing this like well I'm right now
[69:02] fiveyear treasur is trading at whatever
[69:04] 4.5% I can see it going down to 4% now
[69:07] if you're a hedge fund guy you could
[69:09] basically put on a very big lever
[69:10] position you can make billions of
[69:12] dollars if I happen to be right if you
[69:15] are a retail guy sitting at home you can
[69:17] probably do one of these two times
[69:18] something but what I'm telling you is
[69:20] that bonds are very cheap right now
[69:23] relative to stocks I'm talking about US
[69:24] government bonds US government bonds
[69:26] right now has never been cheaper in a
[69:27] very long time US Stocks have never been
[69:30] more expensive very long time so I think
[69:32] if you're long stocks then you
[69:34] definitely want to buy some more bonds
[69:36] because if stocks were to have a
[69:38] pullback bonds would do very well
[69:39] because right now the market is is
[69:41] basically betting that Trump is going to
[69:43] go after China with tar that Trump is
[69:46] going to blow up the deficit that's why
[69:48] Bond are so high and I think if I'm
[69:50] right about Trump which is that you're
[69:52] going to see fiscal tightening you're
[69:54] going to as a result you're not going to
[69:55] see too much tariffs that's actually
[69:58] very bullish for US government bonds why
[70:00] the
[70:01] fiveyear why the fiveyear the reason is
[70:03] very simple because like as you probably
[70:06] know like you know Jenny
[70:09] Allen but Joe Biden treasury secretary
[70:12] over the last year especially issue a
[70:15] lot of treasury bills okay to finance
[70:17] the massive us budget deficit okay in
[70:21] order to contain the interest cost as a
[70:24] result scottt Besson is inheriting a
[70:27] massive a very very unfriendly you know
[70:30] you know refinancing schedule I mean
[70:32] this year the US looks like will have to
[70:34] roll over about we'll have to issue and
[70:37] roll over about altogether $3 trillion
[70:39] worth of issuance I mean which is a
[70:41] pretty scary number if you think about
[70:42] it you have to find that many people to
[70:44] buy3 trillion dollars of us bonds
[70:47] especially if it's going to be any
[70:48] maturity so from that point of view the
[70:50] danger of owning anything higher is that
[70:54] like you know if Trum makes a misstep
[70:57] you know you could see a blow up in the
[70:58] ball Market by the way so this is why I
[71:01] don't want to go very far five year is
[71:04] fine because five year is also a bet on
[71:06] what the FED is going to do it's largely
[71:08] a bet on what the FED is going to do and
[71:10] I think that if that would to happen the
[71:11] FED will be cutting interest rates very
[71:13] aggressively so all in all this is the
[71:16] situation so you got to think nothing is
[71:18] going to be obvious this year I think
[71:19] 2025 is going to be much more difficult
[71:21] to make money than 2024 so watch out
[71:25] yeah well again like well I'd love to
[71:27] keep you know bringing you on as as
[71:29] often as you'll join us because this is
[71:32] such a fascinating conversation I I
[71:34] could go much longer with you David I
[71:36] could listen to you for hours and hours
[71:38] um I want to give you the final few
[71:40] minutes here let folks know where they
[71:41] can find you you have an amazing YouTube
[71:43] channel by the way so be sure to plug
[71:45] that where they can find you learn more
[71:47] about your work at David Woo Unbound and
[71:49] anything that you'd like to leave this
[71:50] audience to think about the floor is all
[71:52] yours sure I just want to say you know
[71:54] like you know my YouTube channel is
[71:56] obviously free which is great you know
[71:58] I'm just trying to promote mean any the
[72:01] day you know again the world today is in
[72:04] serious trouble because you know
[72:07] Americans consider China as an enemy and
[72:10] the Chinese consider the US increasingly
[72:12] as an enemy and then we are now on the
[72:14] brink of World War I and my hope I'm
[72:17] praying every day that this won't happen
[72:19] because nobody's going to win in World
[72:21] War II so from that point of view my ch
[72:25] while it's about investing how to make
[72:27] money and so on so forth I try to look
[72:29] at everything through the lens of money
[72:32] so that people won't accuse me well at
[72:35] least I won't be seen as being
[72:37] ideologically motivated in any way so if
[72:40] you want to get the real objective way
[72:43] of looking at the world and making
[72:45] predictions and then maybe hopefully
[72:47] make some money while at least not to
[72:48] lose any money check out my channel on
