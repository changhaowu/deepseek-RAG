[00:00] In a video a month ago I predicted that 
the AI bubble was set to burst in 2025
[00:05] The DeepSeek news has only strengthened my view
[00:08] The most important takeaway from DeepSeek is not  
[00:11] the prowess of Chinese innovation but 
the fact that AI lends itself to copy
[00:17] What does this mean for the US stock 
market, US rates, and the US dollar?
[00:21] What lessons can we learn from 
the bursting of the dot-com?
[00:24] What should you be doing 
with your money right now?
[00:47] ……
 
 
[00:48] The history of the human race is a story 
of technological advancement and conquest.
[00:54] 40,000 years ago, our African ancestors, the homo 
sapiens, arrived in Europe with bows and arrows,  
[01:00] the first projectile weapon in history, and made 
mincemeat out of the spear wielding Neanderthals.
[01:08] 5000 years ago, the invention of 
the chariot enabled the ancient  
[01:12] Egyptians and Assyrians in their conquests.
[01:16] 2000 years ago, advancement in Roman 
metallurgy, by making iron weapons such  
[01:21] as the gladius stronger, sharper, and more 
resilient, helped the Roman legions defeat  
[01:27] larger armies in their conquests of much of 
Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
[01:33] A 1000 years ago, Mongol calvary archers, 
riding hands-free using the stirrups first  
[01:38] invented in China, went on to conquer 
the largest contiguous empire in history.
[01:45] 250 years ago, the industrial revolution, 
with its technology and military advancements,  
[01:50] helped Britain to subjugate and rule 
over 23% of the world’s population.
[01:56] Innovate or die.
[01:59] Or copy.
[02:01] Spies sent by the US government to Europe to 
steal industrial secrets in the late 18th and  
[02:06] early 19th century laid the foundation of 
the industrialization of the United States
[02:11] Japan’s journey to become an industrial 
powerhouse after world war 2 began with  
[02:17] reverse engineering American 
products from TVs to cars.
[02:22] The Asian tigers, like South Korea, got their 
starts from copying Japanese technologies
[02:28] In much the same way, the technological leap of 
China over the past 20 years wouldn’t have been  
[02:33] possible without copying technologies 
and pursuing a policy of requiring  
[02:37] technology transfer from western firms as 
a condition for doing business in China.
[02:43] Technology is power
[02:46] It has been always been and it will always be
[02:50] And the stakes have never been higher as now.
[02:55] …….
[02:58] The US economy is 26% of world GDP 
but its stock market accounts for  
[03:03] 63% of the market capitalization of 
the world stock market. (Chart 1)
[03:09] This is because US companies are 
on the whole more profitable than  
[03:12] their foreign competitors and their 
earnings growth fasters (Chart 2)
[03:17] 4 out of the 5 most profitable companies 
in the world are US companies. (Chart 3)
[03:22] What makes these companies so profitable?
[03:25] Technology and competition.
[03:28] It is no coincidence that the most profitable 
US companies today are technology companies.
[03:34] Tech companies tend to enjoy higher gross margins
[03:37] This is because their marginal cost tends 
to be lower than in other industries
[03:42] This is especially the case 
once they become dominant.
[03:45] Window is 74% of the market for operating systems,  
[03:49] Google 90% of search, and Apple sells 
57% the smart phones sold in the US
[03:56] Dominance is self-perpetuating
[04:00] In technology, big means you can spend more money  
[04:03] on Research and Development 
to keep out the competition.
[04:06] It is no surprise that US companies lead the 
world in terms of spending on R&D (Chart 4)
[04:12] But R&D is not the only source of 
the market power of these companies.
[04:18] A 2020 report by the House judiciary 
committee accused these companies  
[04:22] of wielding “their dominance in 
ways that erode entrepreneurship,  
[04:27] degrade Americans’ privacy online, and undermine 
the vibrancy of the free and diverse press”
[04:33] The report concluded that the tech monopolies  
[04:35] are not only stifling competition but 
they are stifling innovation itself.
[04:40] Concerns about the anti-competitive behavior of  
[04:43] the big tech is about the only 
bi-partisan concern in the US
[04:49] Under both the Trump and Biden administrations, 
the FTC and the Justice Department launched  
[04:55] major antitrust lawsuits accusing Silicon 
Valley giants of holding illegal monopolies.
[05:02] Yet very little has actually been done by 
Washington to rein in their monopoly power
[05:09] One reason is that these companies 
have become major political donors  
[05:14] and transformed their market power 
into political power (Chart 5)
[05:19] Another reason has to do with 
the fear of the rise of China
[05:23] In August, a federal court sided with the  
[05:26] Biden administration and declared 
Google to be an illegal monopoly.
[05:31] One of the remedies the Justice Department 
was seeking was breaking up the company.
[05:37] Asked about the case before the elections,  
[05:39] Trump warned that breaking up companies 
can be “a very dangerous thing” because  
[05:44] the United States did not want to lose out 
to China on having “great” tech companies.
[05:52] America’s fear of its tech monopolies has been 
soothed by its fear of being surpassed by China
[06:00] These days many people in Washington view the  
[06:03] tech monopolies as America’s saviors 
and think they should be protected
[06:09] The biggest potential winners of the new rules 
on exporting AI chips introduced by Biden in  
[06:15] his last week in office are cloud service 
providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google.
[06:21] What should we expect from Trump 2.0?
[06:24] Will the US maintain its leadership in innovation?
[06:28] What does it mean for the outlook 
for interest rates and the dollar? 
 
 
[06:34] ……
[06:37] One of the defining features of the 
US economy over the past 3 years  
[06:41] has been the decoupling between financial 
conditions and the level of interest rates
[06:46] Real yields on 10 year US government bonds 
have risen to their 20 year high (Chart 6)
[06:51] All else equal, this should have 
tightened financial conditions (Chart 6)
[06:55] But yet financial conditions have 
been easing steadily since 2022  
[07:00] and currently are at levels associated with zero 
interest rates and quantitative easing (Chart 6)
[07:07] The fact that financial conditions 
are so easy is why the Fed is not  
[07:11] under pressure like other central 
banks to cut interest rates (Chart 7)
[07:14] This is why the dollar has 
been so strong (Chart 8)
[07:18] So how do we explain why 
financial conditions are so easy?
[07:23] Simple: the increase in the expected return on  
[07:26] capital that has boosted US 
equity valuation (Chart 9).
[07:31] But what has been driving this increase 
in the expected return on capital?
[07:36] AI, of course
[07:38] Until now the US has been the clear leader in 
AI, in terms of both innovation and adoption
[07:45] The fact that US equities have massively 
outperformed non-US equities and the USD  
[07:50] has done so well is because investors see 
the US as being the primary beneficiary of AI
[07:57] Put differently, AI is why US equity valuation,  
[08:01] US real yields and the USD are all so 
high, in both absolute and relative terms.
[08:08] The DeepSeek news last week 
took the market by surprise.
[08:12] But following a sharp drop in tech 
stocks, Nasdaq has bounced back.
[08:16] Can it be that DeepSeek will prove to 
be just a little blip on the path to  
[08:21] total US technology domination in the age of AI?
[08:29] …..
[08:30] Monopolies are protected 
by higher barriers to entry
[08:33] In the tech sector, this often has to do with the  
[08:36] fact that big innovation is expensive 
and only few companies can afford it.
[08:41] The DeepSeek news last week ran in the face of the  
[08:44] supposition in the market that the 
barriers to entry in AI are high.
[08:48] The fact that DeepSeek, a Chinese 
startup founded only 4 months ago,  
[08:53] is capable of building an AI model that 
can boost of similar performance of Open  
[08:57] AI is not necessarily proof of great innovation.
[09:02] What it does prove is that the 
technology lends itself to copy.
[09:07] DeepSeek may be the first but we can 
be sure that it won’t be the last.
[09:12] Alibaba said this week that its 
model is even better than DeepSeek.
[09:17] Distillation is a technique that allows one 
AI system learning from another AI system
[09:23] The distillation technique involves having 
an established AI model evaluate the answers  
[09:27] coming out of a new model, effectively 
transferring the older model's learnings.
[09:33] Distillation dramatically cuts down the 
training time and costs of building new models.
[09:39] American tech monopolies have yet to start making 
money from their expensive investments in AI
[09:44] Zuckerberg famously said last 
year that he didn’t know when  
[09:47] Meta would be able to recoup 
its expensive AI investment
[09:51] And already the technology is 
at risk of being commoditized.
[09:56] I don’t think Washington can stop 
this even if Trump wanted to.
[10:00] If the US were to somehow decide to 
ban access of Americans to DeepSeek,  
[10:05] the result would be higher prices for AI 
services in the US than outside the US.
[10:11] That would be a disaster for 
American competitiveness.
[10:16] I argued in a video a month ago that I thought the  
[10:18] AI bubble was at risk of bursting in 2025 
(thumbnail: “Trump cannot count on AI”)
[10:22] With the DeepSeek new I think we 
have seen the peak of US tech stocks.
[10:27] The only question how is far down they will go and 
what would it mean for US rates and the US dollar.
[10:36] ------
[10:39] Everyone knows that US equity valuation is at the 
highest level since the dot-com bubble (Chart 10)
[10:45] If there is one lesson from the bursting of the  
[10:47] dot com bubble is that a bubble of this 
magnitude does not burst overnight.
[10:54] Indeed, the dot com bubble peaked in February 2000  
[10:57] and it did not find a bottom 
more than two years later.
[11:00] I don’t know if it will be the same this time.
[11:03] But I think we are far from having seen the bottom
[11:06] The market might have been reassured by the 
news that Softbank is still looking to invest  
[11:11] 25 billion dollars into Open AI and that Meta has 
no plan to downsize its investment plan in AI yet
[11:19] But I would be very surprised if 
the DeepSeek news does not result  
[11:24] in a slowdown in AI investment, given the 
increased uncertainty in its future returns.
[11:29] This is especially so given the large language 
models have already run out of data to train on
[11:36] I think any bounce would be short-lived
[11:40] Another lesson from the bursting 
of the dot com bubble is that the  
[11:43] demand for the USD will suffer, even if 
the effect is not immediate (Chart 11)
[11:49] But the DeepSeek news is bearish for 
the USD to the extent that the rest  
[11:54] of the world might have just caught a big break.
[11:57] The USD benefited in 2024 from 
the perception that the rest of  
[12:00] the world might have to pay a tax to 
the US to access AI in the future.
[12:06] It looks like this will no longer be the case.
[12:08] If AI is going to a game changer 
as its supporters it will be,  
[12:13] it will be to the benefit of 
all countries, rich and poor.
[12:17] As for rates, if financial conditions were 
to tighten as the result of lowered expected  
[12:22] returns on US equities, it would allow the Fed to 
cut rates more aggressive than what is priced in.
[12:29] I am still of the view that in 2025 
bonds will likely outperform stocks,  
[12:35] at least on a risk adjusted basis.
